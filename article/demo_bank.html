<h1>Why we need authenticated cryptography</h1>
<div class="section" id="genesis">
<h2>Genesis</h2>
<p>I was asked the question &quot;Can someone modify an encrypted document without
ever decrypting it?&quot;. The answer is yes, although it is quite counter
intuitive.</p>
<p>For that reason I recommend using the GCM mode which includes the messages
authentication directly. If you are using another mode, for example CBC
(which is what many libraries default to) you <strong>need</strong> to include a HMAC
(Hash-based Message Authentication Code) after having encrypted your data.
For asymmetric cryptography it is the same: cryptographically sign your
messages to detect tampering.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">If you don't know what the mode is, it simply describes how to apply the
cipher when you have more than a block (generally 16 bytes) of data. It
is generally written next to the cipher name. For example AES-256-GCM is
using the AES cipher with a 256 bits key and the GCM mode.</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-simulation">
<h2>The simulation</h2>
<p>In order to demonstrate how an attacker could modify an encrypted message I
wrote a little bank simulation in python. You can find the full code <a class="reference external" href="../file/demo_nomac_tamper.py">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>If you know python you may find some design choices weird. My primary goal
was to produce a code that even a beginner can understand and modify to
experiment other scenarios.</em></p>
<p>Let's launch it to see how it goes. To halt it use Ctl+C.</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block"><code>$ python demo_nomac_tamper.py

Denis   <span class="nv">$5269</span>
Eve     <span class="nv">$0</span></code></pre>
<p>We can see some money transfer requests between different persons. The
hexadecimal string in-between the request and confirmation is the encrypted
message as seen by someone eavesdropping on the network. That person is Eve,
the malicious user that would very much like stealing that money as she has
nothing left on her account.</p>
<p>For now she is only looking at the packets, but let's turn the BE_EVIL flag
at the top of the file and relaunch the demo:</p>
<pre class="code bash literal-block"><code>$ python demo_nomac_tamper.py

Charles <span class="nv">$10000</span>
Denis   <span class="nv">$10000</span>
Eve     <span class="nv">$3115</span></code></pre>
<p>We halted the program at two messages but you can continue. We see that a
transfer request from Alice to Bob was confirmed as being a request from
Alice to Eve! And we also see that a transfer from Bob to Charles gave a
strange error about an user Dqfrles... What is happening there?</p>
<p>We just modified the encrypted message, betting on the fact that it would be
for Bob, so that &quot;Bob&quot; actually decrypts to &quot;Eve&quot;. As all messages aren't for
Bob the others don't decrypt well now, but as the bank will just ignore them
that's no concern for us. So we aren't taking Bob's money but we hijack any
transfer to his account (and block any other transfer in this simple case).</p>

<div class="section" id="why-was-it-possible">
<h2>Why was it possible?</h2>
<img alt="../image/kigurumi_wondering.png" src="../image/kigurumi_wondering.png" style="width: 20%;" />
<p>There are lots of useful comments in the code to explain what we did and how
we did it. I'll focus here on the more mathematical part.</p>
<p>I used the RC4 cipher which is a stream cipher. This means that I don't
encrypt data a block at a time: for each plaintext byte <em>P</em> I will compute a
pseudo-random byte <em>R</em> and XOR the two giving me an ciphered byte <em>C</em>.</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i> = <i>P</i>⊕<i>R</i>
</div>
<p>Of course the random byte isn't really random, it is part of a random-looking
sequence generated by the key so that it can be deciphered. But we aren't
interested in that part, what is interesting is the XOR and the fact that the
first byte of the ciphertext will be the first byte of the plaintext.</p>
<p>XOR-ing two identical bytes gives 0, and this operation can be done in any
order. That's how the cipher works, to decipher the message just generate the
same random bytes and XOR them with the ciphertext:</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>⊕<i>R</i> = <i>P</i>⊕<i>R</i>⊕<i>R</i> = <i>P</i>
</div>
<p>This also means that if we XOR some other <em>M</em> byte with the ciphertext it will
be reflected in the plaintext:</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>’ = <i>C</i>⊕<i>M</i>
</div>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>’⊕<i>R</i> = <i>P</i>⊕<i>R</i>⊕<i>M</i>⊕<i>R</i> = <i>P</i>⊕<i>M</i>
</div>
<p>We can use this to our advantage. Let's suppose that the plaintext byte is a
<em>b</em>, then we can do the following.</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>’ = <i>C</i>⊕<i>b</i>
</div>
<p>If <em>P</em> is indeed a <em>b</em> this will simplify into:</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>’⊕<i>R</i> = (<i>C</i>⊕<i>b</i>)⊕<i>R</i>)
</div>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>’⊕<i>R</i> = ((<i>P</i>⊕<i>R</i>)⊕<i>b</i>)⊕<i>R</i>)
</div>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>’⊕<i>R</i> = (<i>b</i>⊕<i>b</i>⊕<i>R</i>⊕<i>R</i>)
</div>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>’⊕<i>R</i> = 0
</div>
<p>We will have changed our <em>b</em> into 0! But that only works if we know what
byte to change and what value we expect it to be. All that's left to do is to
also XOR the letter we want instead, so an <em>e</em> in our case:</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>’ = <i>C</i>⊕<i>b</i>⊕<i>e</i>
</div>
<div class="formula">
<i>C</i>’⊕<i>R</i> = <i>e</i>
</div>
<p>And that's how we were able to change three bytes. Of course when the
original bytes aren't what we expected them to be it won't decrypt to
anything useful. But as most communications use very structured formats,
emails for example, it is often possible to find something to modify to our
advantage without ever decrypting the message.</p>
