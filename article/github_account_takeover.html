<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Everybody seems to be talking about Github these days so I'll follow the
trend. I don't want to talk about Microsoft though, so instead we'll explore
Github account takeover.</p>
<p>The name is misleading, we won't hack anybody's account. Instead we'll take
advantage of leftover redirections, digging old graves to reanimate dead
projects and see where that leads us.</p>
<p>So let's go digging!</p>
<img alt="../image/girl_shovel.png" src="../image/girl_shovel.png" style="width: 60%;" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="github-redirections">
<h2>Github redirections</h2>
<p>Github proposes a mechanism to help users change their usernames without
breaking other projects altogether: <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-when-i-change-my-username/">redirections</a>.</p>
<p>In summary Github maintains a redirection from your old account URL to your
new one. When someone else claims the username and creates a project with the
same name as the old one the redirection is disabled and the new project in
place takes the lead. People are expected to use that to have more time
changing their projects to the new URL.</p>
<p>Of course this assumption is flawed, nobody ever fixes what isn't broken and
since this is done transparently by Github other projects don't get any kind
of warning. After all, working transparently is the goal of this mechanism.</p>
<p>So, what kind of project would rely on Github URLs? Dependency systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dub-d-s-package-manager">
<h2>Dub: D's package manager</h2>
<p>We'll first have a look at Dub since it is where I first noticed the issue.</p>
<p>Dub's backend, <a class="reference external" href="https://code.dlang.org">https://code.dlang.org</a>, essentially works by registering a
repository through its Github URL (other providers are supported, but Github
is the one we're interested in).  It will then monitor the project for new
tags or branches and recover zip archives of these landmarks automatically.</p>
<p>A project is then able to specify Dub dependencies in its dub.json file.
While there are different way to specify a dependency's version, the most
common allows following all minor updates but not major ones.</p>
<p>The risk is quite clear: if the user changes its Github name after having
registered a project on Dub, then it is possible to create a new Github
account and project with the old name and get Dub to use our code instead of
the original one.</p>

<div class="section" id="listing-listing">
<h3>Listing, listing...</h3>
<p>So, we'll start by enumerating all dead Github accounts that are still in
used. I'm certain there are better ways to do this, but a bit of bash is
easy enough to get the job done.</p>
<pre class="code sh literal-block"><code>dead<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<p>And sure enough we find 17 dead projects (list below). This may not sound
like much but some of them touch cryptography or online payment and together
they totalize about 500 downloads a month. Being able to inject a backdoor
into 500 computers a month in a stealthy way isn't something I'd refuse as an
attacker.</p>
<p>Here are the impacted projects found:</p>
<pre class="code text literal-block"><code>https://code.dlang.org/packages/moeimg-d

<p>If you perform the same test you should find a difference with the <strong>d-beard</strong>
project which doesn't appear dead anymore. This is because I used it to check
that the vulnerability was indeed exploitable. My apologies to the owner but
since the project hasn't received any update in 4 years and I forked the
original it shouldn't break anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exploitation">
<h3>Exploitation</h3>
<p>As one would expect, exploitation is very easy. I just created a new account
name &quot;nuisanceofcats&quot; (love the name by the way).</p>
<img alt="../image/github_takeover_account_creation.png" src="../image/github_takeover_account_creation.png" style="width: 60%;" />
<p>I then created a new project named d-beard. As indicated I didn't want to
break anything so I forked the original, but I could very well have made a
copy and add a backdoor to some functions.</p>
<img alt="../image/github_takeover_forked_project.png" src="../image/github_takeover_forked_project.png" style="width: 100%;" />
<p>All I had to do then was to add a new minor tag. We want a minor tag so that
new projects automatically upgrade their dependency with our &quot;backdoor&quot;. Of
course my tag contained no modification to the code. On the screenshot the
date is set in 2014 because it takes the date of the commit, not when it was
tagged.</p>
<img alt="../image/github_takeover_new_tag.png" src="../image/github_takeover_new_tag.png" style="width: 35%;" />
<p>And that's it. Nice, easy, and quite hard to detect if the legitimate owner
doesn't notice it himself since we obtained the account in a proper way and
no code was broken.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="well-go-on-then">
<h2>Well, Go on then!</h2>
<p>This is not restricted to Dub of course. Another language that had my
attention was Go. While it doesn't have a package manager its import system
natively supports importing libraries from Github repositories. This is very
interesting in our case.</p>
<p>The lack of Go repository complicates the task of listing vulnerable
repositories. Furthermore I must say that I don't know the language well so
I'm not very familiar with its customs and whether there are recommended
places listing projects.</p>
<p>I decided to look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Projects">list of open-source projects</a> in the wiki, but
with only about 1200 elements it amounts to 0.5% of all Go projects on
Github. Still, I found 17 impacted projects. I also had a look at the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go">awesome-go</a> which brought 5 more projects (last in the list below).</p>

<p>I have no statistics, but judging by the number of stars those projects get
together far more than 500 downloads a day.</p>
<p>I won't redo the attack, you get the idea by now. It is even more worrisome
though as at least with Dub we were able to quickly find an exhaustive list
(at a given time, of course things can change fast), but with Go all projects
are potentially impacted with no easy way to test for legitimacy.</p>

<div class="section" id="there-s-maur">
<h2>There's mAUR</h2>
<p>No let's have a look at Archlinux's semi-official package system: <a class="reference external" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a>.</p>
<p>AUR is a collection of installation scripts named PKGBUILD. They allow
installing things easily even though they are not precompiled in the official
repositories.</p>
<p>It is very often made clear that the security of AUR packages is the
responsibility of the user (which by the way is utterly stupid; not that I
don't understand the intent but no security system ever worked when leaving
it to the user). This is why what we're discussing here much likely won't be
considered an AUR vulnerability even though the user has pretty much no way
to check the packages.</p>
<p>What we're interested in are git packages. Normally with AUR you would
specify the source of what you're installing and a set of checksums to make
sure you effectively downloaded the right package. Some package follow the
master branch though, so as they can't know the checksum in advance they skip
it and no checksum verification is performed. Those packages are by
convention specified with a &quot;-git&quot; extension.</p>
<p>Of course that means we might be able to take some over. And by some I mean
about 84 by my latest count. I won't burden you with the list, it's <a class="reference external" href="../file/github_takeover_aur_impacted_projects.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>84 is much lower than what I had imagined but it's still a good catch. I fear
my approach wasn't that good on that one so I must have missed some. Here's
the dirty script if anyone cares to do better:</p>

<p>It should be noted that even though the packages follow master, no update
usually happen until someone updates the AUR package. This means we get to
inject our malicious commit into new user's packages but not old ones until
there is an update. Or unless he uses a handy AUR helper such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay">yay</a> which
follows git updates on its own. Don't get me wrong, yay is a good software,
but it does expose users even more in that specific case.</p>

<h2>What to do</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>If you are a developer:</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Please, do the responsible thing and don't let your projects behind.
This jeopardizes your users. Go back and change the places where your
projects are registered. Notify your users.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>If you are a user:</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Always question the code you are importing. Just because it is sane at
one point in time doesn't mean it'll still be when you reuse it. The
developer may be wicked, hacked or undead projects may raise from their
tomb again to haunt you.</p>
<p>I published the lists of impacted projects so that you know they exist.
If you are using one of them and it has come back from the dead you know
something is going on. It should either remain dead or change URL
completely to the new repository.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>If you manage a project like Dub or Go:</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Please don't rely on Github URLs. These are not meant to be stable.
If you do and are aware of undead projects update the redirections as
soon as possible.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>If you are Github:</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Thanks for reading me. Can you go back to breaking repositories with
renames instead of opening vulnerabilities everywhere else please? At the
very least there should be some bells and whistles when someone
overwrites a redirection so that the owner can tell that something fishy
is going on.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The story doesn't end here. Many other projects rely on Github URLs, and I am
pretty sure that it will be attacked if it's not already the case.</p>
<p>And this is not a new attack, a very common way to use Github account
takeovers is using <a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>. If you redirect one of your subdomain to
an abandoned Github page anyone can create the corresponding account and
obtain a subdomain of your website. This opens the door to many things from
phishing to data disclosure.</p>
<p>What really frightens me is how difficult such an attack is to detect. Since
the attacker is the legitimate owner of the repository there is no way to
link it back to its previous owner, especially if the account is well copied.
The only possibility I see is for the owner to find that fake account, but
why would he ever check for such things?</p>
