<h1>Privilege escalations</h1>
<p>This post is part of the <a class="reference external" href="source_code_review.html">Source Code Review</a> series.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Privilege escalations lie in the mist of process permissions.</p>
<p>The idea of a privilege escalation is to gain more rights than you have by
getting a privileged process to execute some code on your behalf. This can be
done legitimately as with sudo on GNU/Linux systems. It can also be done by
finding a password in a log file. But those aren't worth an article. Let's
talk about when it's done unknowingly of the privileged process by exploiting
some flashy bug.</p>
<p>We will concentrate on one type of privilege escalation that involves no
memory corruption (although it is interesting to note that what is done with
such corruption is very similar but with memory addresses instead of files).</p>

<div class="section" id="missing-verification">
<h2>Missing verification</h2>
<p>The easiest case is when there is no verification at all:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><code><span class="n">origin</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/mytmp/my-cd-list&quot;</span>
<span class="n">destination</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/mytmp/my-cd-list.bkp&quot;</span>

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">origin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;rb&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">fi</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">destination</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;wb&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">fo</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">fo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fi</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">())</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's assume that this code is ran as a high-privileged process as a
scheduled job and that the files always exist. We will also suppose for
simplification that the rights over <em>/tmp/mytmp</em> allow any user to delete
or create any file in that directory, but the two files can't be read or
modified by anybody but the privileged process.</p>
<p>Any user could remove the files and replace them by symbolic links to other
files. Doing so the attacker would get at the same time an arbitrary read of
any file by copying them elsewhere, or an arbitrary write which he could use
to overwrite the content of sudo for example.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">Keywords: open write read chmod rename chdir</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="race-condition">
<h2>Race condition</h2>
<p>It is not always as clear as in the previous snippet. It can happen as a race
condition:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">subprocess</span>

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/mytmp/tmp.sh&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;echo 'Harmless script'&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s2">&quot;sh&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/mytmp/tmp.sh&quot;</span><span class="p">])</span></code></pre>
<p>When programming, we tend to see our code as one continuous flow of
execution. That's not the case: the OS can stop our program at any time to
execute someone else's code. Here one could swap the file by another between
the moment when the file is written and the call to Popen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="failed-exception">
<h2>Failed exception</h2>
<p>Another case is the bogus exception:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">subprocess</span>

<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/mytmp/tmp.sh&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;echo 'Harmless script'&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">except</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="c1"># TODO: handle error</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s2">&quot;sh&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/mytmp/tmp.sh&quot;</span><span class="p">])</span></code></pre>
<p>This makes the problem way easier for an attacker: just create a file
<em>/tmp/mytmp/tmp.sh</em> that has no write rights. The call to <strong>open</strong> will
raise an exception, the <strong>write</strong> will never be executed and the program will
gracefully continue its execution running your code.</p>
<p>Any time an error is ignored it is important to understand what is really
ignored and what it could mean to an attacker.</p>

<div class="section" id="time-of-check-to-time-of-use">
<h2>Time Of Check To Time Of Use</h2>
<p>TOCTTOUs are a special case of race condition. They happen when a program
first checks a property and then uses a resource on the assumption of the
first property.</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

<span class="n">origin</span>      <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/cd-list/my-cd-list&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">exit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">origin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;rb&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">fi</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">destination</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;wb&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">fo</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">fo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fi</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">())</span></code></pre>
<p>The code looks fine at first: by checking that the argument is a real file
and not some link we avoid the risk of the user maliciously putting a
symbolic link to change the actual file used. However, with a closer look it
is vulnerable to a TOCTTOU.</p>
<p>As the check happens before the file is opened it is possible for an attacker
to swap the file for a malicious link between the call to <strong>islink</strong> and the
call to <strong>open</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course the time frame is narrow but privilege escalations have a huge
advantage over remote exploits: the attacker already has a foot on the
system. He can try as long as he wants before finally getting into the
time frame as he only needs to win the race once.</p>
<img alt="../image/rainbowdash-running.png" src="../image/rainbowdash-running.png" style="width: 40%;" />
<p>The solution would be to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>open both files</p></li>
<li><p>check that none is a link</p></li>
<li><p>read/write the files</p></li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="section" id="unsafe-paths">
<h2>Unsafe paths</h2>
<p>When executing a file, if a path isn't explicitly given, it is inferred from
a list of directories containing common executables: the PATH.</p>
<p>When calling <strong>ls</strong> which is used? What program is really being used? What if
another executable with the same name was created in another directory of the
PATH?</p>
<p>While this doesn't happen much with common PATHs because creating files in
the first PATH directories generally needs many privileges, it is quite
common to have similar flaws with programs that rely on deduction for paths
or use custom PATH variables.</p>
<p>This can also touch libraries of course, it doesn't have to be an
executable. In python importing a file is done by executing it. On windows
LoadLibrary loads a DLL, but if only the name is given then it starts its
search in the executable directory (which may very well be the web download
directory).</p>
<p>There is also a special case for Windows unquoted paths. Let's imagine a batch
script with the following content:</p>
<pre class="code batch literal-block"><code><span class="p">&#64;</span><span class="k">echo</span> off
C<span class="p">:</span><span class="nl">\Super</span><span class="c1"> Calc\calc++.exe</span></code></pre>
<p>Straight and forward, this executes the program with a full path to avoid any
ambiguity... or is there? Let's decompose the reasoning of Windows to find
what to execute:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>There is a space after Super, it must be the name of the program</p></li>
<li><p>Does C:\Super.exe exist? Nope.</p></li>
<li><p>Then it must be a folder. Does &quot;Super Calc&quot; exist?</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, execute &quot;C:\Super Calc\calc++.exe&quot;.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This means that if an attacker has the right to create a file in C: he can
create the file &quot;C:\Super.exe&quot; and this file will be executed instead of
&quot;C:\Super Calc\calc++.exe&quot; by the script. If the script isn't run with the
same privileges as the attacker it is a privilege escalation.</p>
<p>This unquoted path vulnerability is a great example of what can go wrong when
relying on smart systems.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This covers the most common issues leading to privilege escalations. We
talked a great deal about files because that's a common point of failure but
note that it could very well be any other kind of resource.</p>
<p>Privilege escalations based on memory corruption generally happen the same
way: some privileged thread or process executes a function pointer that the
attacker swaps with his own using a bug such as a buffer overflow or a
use-after-free.</p>
