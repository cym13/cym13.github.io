<h2>A look at the Vault password manager</h2>
<section id="motivation">
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I recently had a look at many password managers and I stumbled on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gabfl/vault">Vault</a> which is a relatively small Python
project (no relation to Hashicorp Vault). This project happens to showcase
several vulnerabilities common to storage encryption that I think make it a
nice and educational case.</p>
<p>The author was contacted but all development is halted on the project and
none of the vulnerabilities we will discuss is exploitable with the default
configuration. Still, it's worth noting that we're discussing unfixed issues.</p>
</section>
<section id="presentation">
<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>Vault is a password manager that relies on symmetric cryptography (so the
same key is used for encryption and decryption of the passwords). It uses two
layers of security: the first is an encrypted database using SQLCipher, the
second is homemade encryption of specific fields. It's this second layer that
we're going to discuss.</p>
<p>In the default configuration Vault none of the vulnerabilities are
exploitable due to SQLCipher. It is however possible to disable SQLCipher and
these configurations are vulnerable. I'll suppose that we're in this
vulnerable configuration for what follows.</p>
<p>Of course, the goal of this blog post isn't to dunk on a small python
project, but to take some time to understand the kind of specific
cryptographical issues that can arise in such software.</p>

<h3>You don't protect what you don't encrypt</h3>
<p>Vault encrypts several elements (passwords, notes…) but not every aspect of
an entry is. That's a mistake.</p>
<p>This is pretty straightforward: if I'm an attacker and I can see a list
of URLs I'm already very happy. There might be important information
within the URL, there might be blackmail potential (&quot;feetlover.xxx&quot;),
there are many indications of habits that can help set a phishing
campaign (here's a LinkedIn password, let's send a LinkedIn-looking
email). The same is true of login (often emails) and entry names.</p>
<p>In general, you should encrypt as much as possible to avoid leaking important
metadata. You don't protect what you don't encrypt.</p>
<p>This is a short point, easily dismissed, but just because it's not a very
technical point it's a very important aspect of data safety.</p>

<section id="keys-must-be-derived-from-a-pbkdf-1">
<h3>Keys must be derived from a PBKDF</h3>
<p>Vault uses SHA256 to transform the master password into an encryption key
for AES-256.</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block"><code><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">digest_key</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span><span class="w">

        Use SHA-256 over our key to get a proper-sized AES key
    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="w">

</span>    <span class="c1"># Add optional salt to key</span><span class="w">
</span>    <span class="n">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="w">
</span>    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">salted_key</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span>        <span class="n">key</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">salted_key</span><span class="w">

</span>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">SHA256</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">digest</span><span class="p">()</span></code></pre>
<p>The issue is that SHA-256 is not designed to produce keys and
lacks many security features to be suitable for that task. The result is a
known-plaintext attack that leads to an attack on the master key.</p>
<p>Let's say that I'm an attacker and I have access to the encrypted
database but not the master key. It is an important requirement, but this
case is the reason why we use encryption in the first place so it's not
unreasonable. Now let's say that I know any 1 plaintext password from
the vault: either gained through phishing, through a leaked hacked
database, or because I own one of the websites. Since I possess both the
plaintext and ciphertext for that entry I can try encrypting the
plaintext with different master passwords and check if the ciphertext
matches. If it does, I found the correct master password.</p>
<p>In essence that attack turns a couple plaintext/ciphertext into a hash
which I can crack like any other hash. The hash function in that case is
SHA256+AES-256, both of which are designed to be as fast and optimized as
possible, making the cracking process very easy.</p>
<p>This is why it's very important to use a proper Password-Based Key
Derivation Function (PBKDF). The best is argon2, then scrypt, not bcrypt which
isn't a KDF and not PBKDF2 which is deprecated because the only
way to make it secure it to use an insanely high number of rounds
so it takes several seconds to compute.</p>
<p>If argon2 for example was used here, I could of course use the same strategy
of encrypting a known plaintext with a candidate password to compare it with
the ciphertext found in the database, but that process would be</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>very slow,</p></li>
<li><p>very much not GPU-friendly and</p></li>
<li><p>very memory intensive. Nothing a user would notice during normal use, but
enough to make testing tons of passwords unfeasible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And if the attacker doesn't know any plaintext password, they can
attack the notes: any DB is pretty much guaranteed to have at least 1
empty note and that's a plaintext. You can just encrypt the empty string
(for every salt and IV) and see whether one matches the encrypted note.
It's slower since it's not focused on 1 &quot;hash&quot; but it's not too bad.</p>
<p>Also, note that salts play no real role here since every encrypted
field already has a random value unique to that encryption: the IV.</p>
<p>So, to be clear, Vault should use argon2, not SHA-256, otherwise an attacker
with access to the encrypted passwords may use them to crack the master key.
This is the most important issue of this mail since its prerequisite (having
access to the encrypted passwords) falls into the core of a password
manager's threat model.</p>

<section id="contexts-must-be-bound-1">
<h3>Contexts must be bound</h3>
<p>Vault uses AES with the CBC block cipher mode. CBC is not an AEAD and this
means that it doesn't provide tools to authenticate data and bind contexts.
This allows a Confused Deputy attack.</p>
<section id="block-cipher-modes">
<h4>Block cipher modes</h4>
<p>Every time we talk about AES we end up talking about modes. That's because
they're the unsung heroes of block cipher cryptography. AES is a solid block
cipher. This means that it's very good at its job, and that its job is to
take 128 bits of data with a key and to output 128 bits of random-looking
data. The world of AES starts and stops at 128 bits of data: it cannot work
on anything smaller or larger (and if you're wondering, the 256 in AES-256
refers to the key size, but it's still only a block size of 128 bits).</p>
<p>Of course that's an issue as we rarely have to encrypt <em>exactly</em> 128 bits of
data. So we developed systems to work around these limitations. Paddings
allow us to work with less than 128 bits, modes allow us to work with more.</p>
<p>A mode is how we chunk and combine data so it can be used by a block cipher
such as AES. There are tons of modes such as ECB, CBC, CTR, OFB, GCM… And
while AES on its own is very good at its job, choosing the wrong mode can
completely break encryption. This is an extremely common point of failure for
systems boasting &quot;Military grade AES-256 security!&quot; without considering that
AES alone can't do much.</p>
<p>An example of a block cipher that must never be used is ECB as demonstrated
by the famous ECB Penguin.</p>

<p>CBC is a much better mode and is successfully used in many applications. In
fact it's even used by SQLCipher, the second and successful layer of security
present in Vault.</p>
<p>And yet, you probably shouldn't use CBC. Ever.</p>
<p>It's not really a bad mode, but it is an incomplete one by today's standards
and as such it should only be used if you know what it lacks and how to
implement it.</p>
<p>Assuming you're using a random, unique IV (which is the case in Vault) and a
reasonable block cipher like AES, CBC guarantees the confidentiality of your
data: nobody can read it without the key. However, it does not provide any
protection regarding the authenticity of your encrypted data (tampering
detection/protection) or information regarding the context.  This means that
someone can modify, replace, swap, add or remove data without anyone the
wiser and CBC won't do anything to prevent it. After all, it's a very very
old mode.</p>
<p>To make it usable, you could make Careful use of HMAC to provide
authentication, alongside a specific key derivation scheme since the same key
mustn't be used for encryption and message authentication, and a way to add
associated data in order to have a context, but without any canonicalization
issue… It's really not that easy to get right.</p>
<p>But we have modes that include all that by default. They're called AEAD modes
(Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) like GCM for example.</p>
</section>
<section id="authenticated-encryption-with-associated-data">
<h4>Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data</h4>
<p>By using an AEAD mode such as GCM instead of CBC by default you would
automatically gain authenticity of the encrypted message: it would no longer
be possible to modify an encrypted message and have it decrypt properly. Such
blind modifications can be used for many things such as padding oracles that
decrypt the entire message (not an issue in this specific context). But
using an AEAD also provides something more critical to our use-case:
context-binding associated data. In short you can specify arbitrary data
(say, an URL) at encryption. It won't be encrypted so it takes no space, but
you need to provide the same data at decryption for it to succeed. This
allows you to bind a ciphertext to a specific context.</p>
</section>
<section id="confused-deputy-attack">
<h4>Confused Deputy attack</h4>
<p>Let's look at a current possible attack to see why that's interesting.</p>
<p>Let's say I get access to your vault but I don't have the key. I do
however have happen to own one of the websites present in your database.
Maybe I'm from your company's IT so I control internal tools and have
remote access to your desktop? Let's call it company.com. What I really
want is your gmail password.</p>
<p>What I can do is replace the encrypted company.com password with the
encrypted gmail one.  Since it's the same key anyway, either will decrypt
properly. Now all I have to do is setup logs on company.com and wait for you
to log in. When you do, the password will be marked incorrect. Maybe there will
even be a message that it expired and a new one must be chosen. Not a problem
you think. But the &quot;wrong&quot; password you sent me was actually the same as your
gmail account, and in clear text. I know have access to your personal mail.
We call this attack (database manipulation to force decryption in a different
context) a confused deputy attack.</p>

@enduml -->
<p>This all happened because encrypted passwords exist in a vacuum,
there's no relation between them and their URL other than the fact that
they're on the same database line, and that line can be manipulated by an
attacker with access to the system (which is well within the threat model
of a password manager).</p>
<p>Instead, by using an AEAD such as GCM, you could pass the login and URL
as additional data to the encryption. That way the decryption will be
bound to this login and URL and attempting to use the encrypted password
in a different context will not result in successful decryption. Note
that GCM uses a 12-byte random IV, not a 16 one.</p>

<p>As you can see the gen_salt function is actually a rather weak human password
generator (there is absolutely no reason for that) and the salt is just
appended to the key before hashing it with SHA256.</p>
<p>Such salts don't make encryption/decryption more difficult since they're not
secrets: if an attacker has access to the system, they have access to the
salts. They can just use them, move them around… performing any of the
attacks discussed before is no more complicated than without salt.</p>
<p>This probably stems from a confusion about the purpose of salts in classical,
hash-based password storage.</p>
<p>Salts are very important when hashing because hashes are deterministic
functions: if you hash the same data twice, you'll get the same hash both
times. In hash-based password storage (what most websites do) it's
important because it means that without salt any two users that have the
same password will have the same hash in the database. That makes it
easier to focus attacks and it makes it possible to use pre-computed
dictionaries (&quot;rainbow tables&quot;). So we introduce a random element to each
hash to make it different. Since its only purpose is to be different from
any other, it contains no information and isn't secret so we can store it
alongside its hash without issue. That's the salt.</p>
<p>It turns out that encryption has a similar issue: encryption functions
such as AES are deterministic as well so encrypting the same message
twice results in the same encrypted message. This is obviously a leak of
information: if we imagine a simple protocol with two messages
&quot;buy&quot;/&quot;sell&quot;, even if they're encrypted to 881823/6628482 it will soon be
clear which is which to an external observer. So we came up with the same
solution: add data to the message to make it unique even if the original
message is always the same. That's what the IV is. Since the IV can be
used in different ways by the mode, each mode has its own requirements
regarding the IV, but being cryptographically random is generally the
right approach. It's certainly the case for CBC and GCM. And just like
salts in the context of hashing, IVs aren't secret and are often stored
alongside the ciphertext (by convention it's generally the first block).</p>
<p>So separate salts really add nothing in all this context: they don't bind
a context and each encrypted message already  has a salt, it's just
called an IV in this context. They don't add to the master key either
since it's a key and not a message: it doesn't do anything. I'd suggest
removing them entirely, simplifying the code and reducing the potential
for bugs while improving performances (I mean, in theory, it's probably
not noticeable).</p>

<h3>Bonus: invalid padding</h3>
<p>A small bonus, but you might have noticed that padding calculation is wrong:</p>

<p>This is akin to PKCS8 padding which fills to the end of the last block
(16-byte blocks for AES) with how many bytes are missing. That part is
implemented correctly. However, PKCS8 also stipulates that if no padding is
necessary, then a full block of padding must be added. This is to remove any
ambiguity: there is always padding and it must always be removed in the same
way.</p>
<p>Here, in the absence of this detail, we see a bug when no padding is
necessary: decryption doesn't happen properly.</p>

<p>If no padding was necessary during encryption, none was added. But during
decryption we attempt to remove padding anyway. If the last character of our
legitimate password was 0x01, 0x0202, 0x030303… then no padding error will be
raised and that last character will simply be removed. If the end of our
password doesn't correspond to legitimate padding (the most likely scenario)
then an Invalid Padding error is raised and the password cannot be accessed
anymore by the user.</p>
<p>This is no vulnerability, just a bug, but it adds to the argument that you
shouldn't just improvise important pieces such as paddings.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So, what's the point of all this? Dunking on amateur cryptography in a small
abandoned open-source project to make the author feel bad?</p>
<p>Of course not. My goal here was first and foremost to inform users and
developers that storage encryption is harder than it seems. There are many
things to consider and many interesting angles to consider that are quite
different from the communication protocols commonly discussed when talking
about cryptography. Things like Confused Deputy attacks or good key
derivation become very important as messages are not ephemeral. And it's a
good opportunity to talk once again about authenticated encryption, AEAD
modes and overall cryptographic design.</p>
<p>I hope this can be inspiring, if only to make less mistakes in other projects.</p>
