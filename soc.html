<p>Just had a nice thought... Is there a real x such that x^x=i ?</p>
<p>Suppose by contradiction</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>x</i> ∈ ℝ, <i>x</i><sup><i>x</i></sup> = <i>i</i>
</div>
<p>Then,</p>
<div class="formula">
ln(<i>x</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>) = ln(<i>i</i>)
</div>
<div class="formula">
<i>x</i>ln(<i>x</i>) = ln(<i>i</i>) = ln(<i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>π</i> ⁄ 2</sup>) = <i>i</i><i>π</i> ⁄ 2
</div>
<div class="formula">
<i>x</i>ln(<i>x</i>) = <i>i</i><i>π</i> ⁄ 2
</div>
<p>But</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>x</i><sup><i>x</i></sup> = <i>i</i>  ⇒  <i>x</i>ln(<i>x</i>) = <i>x</i><sup><i>x</i></sup><i>π</i> ⁄ 2
</div>
<p>Then, by taking the derivative on both sides</p>
<div class="formula">
(2 ⁄ <i>π</i>)⋅(1 + ln(<i>x</i>)) = <i>x</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>⋅(1 + ln(<i>x</i>))
</div>
<p>We can't simplify if 1+ln(x)=0 which happens for x=e^-1, so let's consider
that case first.</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>x</i> = <i>e</i><sup> − 1</sup>  ⇒  <i>e</i><sup> − 1</sup>⋅ln(<i>e</i><sup> − 1</sup>) = <i>i</i><i>π</i> ⁄ 2
</div>
<div class="formula">
  ⇒   − <i>e</i><sup> − 1</sup> = <i>i</i><i>π</i> ⁄ 2
</div>
<p>which is false. So e^-1 can't be solution of our equation. Let's continue
with x≠e^-1 by simplifying left and right the (1+ln(x)) term:</p>
<div class="formula">
2 ⁄ <i>π</i> = <i>x</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>
</div>
<div class="formula">
2 ⁄ <i>π</i> = (2 ⁄ <i>π</i>)⋅<i>x</i>ln(<i>x</i>)
</div>
<div class="formula">
1 = <i>x</i>ln(<i>x</i>)
</div>
<div class="formula">
<i>e</i> = <i>x</i><sup><i>x</i></sup>
</div>
<p>But as previously established</p>
<div class="formula">
<i>x</i><sup><i>x</i></sup> = 2 ⁄ <i>π</i>  ⇒  <i>e</i> = 2 ⁄ <i>π</i>
</div>
<p>Which is false. Therefore since supposing the existence of a solution leads
only to contradiction we proved that no real number is solution.</p>
<div class="formula">
∄<i>x</i> ∈ ℝ, <i>x</i><sup><i>x</i></sup> = <i>i</i>
</div>
<p>Nothing groundbreaking, just a thought. It's funny how all my proofs end up
being proofs by contradiction one way or another even though it is frowned
upon in serious circles.</p>

<p>I just tried cooking Corned Beef for the first time.</p>
<p>With the whole Covid-19 thing I noticed that my main issue with food wasn't
longevity but diversity and while I had no issue finding really good canned
fish, beef was another matter entirely.</p>
<p>And now I think I know why. It's pretty strange stuff. The can I used was as
&quot;pur&quot; beef as you can get, 98.7% beast and a dash of salt and E250. The smell
is not nice. You can get used to it I think. It's has a vibrant red color
which, for some reason, didn't change at all when cooked in a hot pan. This
is unusual. Beef turns grey normally when cooked. This did not change color a
bit. There's no colourant indicated though. Weird.</p>
<p>I had some rice and pasta leftovers so I mixed them all in a hot pan with a
dash of olive oil and the meat. Really basic, just to get a feel of the food.
I ended up adding quite a lot of black pepper and garlic as well as some hot
pepper and salt. I would really have liked an onion but there was none to be
found. Generally trying to overspice food is not a good sign, and rightly so,
but now it kind of smell like american hamburgers, where there is more spice
and herbs than actual meat.</p>
<p>Weird. Not bad though. Bit too much to pepper.</p>
<p>Will I start pilling beef cans in my stock? Probably not. The taste isn't
worth it and these cans are too big for a single meal so I'm stuck with it
for the next day at least. I would much rather have more kind of fish cans
and complete dishes such as canned raviolis in case I really start craving
meat. Still, this was a nice experience overall.</p>
