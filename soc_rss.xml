        <description>I'm completely battered from a sleepless night due to an unexpected
intervention on a client's network, but somehow I still managed to turn an
old jean into a proper new pocket for one of my favorite pants. The fabric
was flimsy and easily torn apart by the various items I keep in my pocket
everyday.

It was my first real sewing project and I'm very glad with how it turned out.
It was also quite easy overall:

- Cut the old pocket
- Reproduce its shape on the jean's fabric, leaving a bit more fabric to
  reattach it to the pants afterward. Also prepare the mirror image of that
  part.
- I first used a blanket stitch to sew the two halves of my pocket inside
  out (interior outside), that helps reduce tearing
- I then collapsed the pocket on itself like a sock to get the interior
  inside and used a back stitch along the edge to reinforce the blanket
  stitch and protect it from items within the pocket
- The most tedious part was attaching the pocket back to the leg, I used a
  back stitch for that which was good, but not as clean as I'd have liked it
  to be. I should think about that part more the next time I attempt it.

All in all a very clean result from the outside, it doesn't look like it's
going to tear easily and the visual result is quite nice even though my
techniques definitely needs some work. The entire project took maybe 3 or 4
hours.

I think I'll get more sewing supplies and try other things, such as sewing
some elastic fabric to create a sub-pocket that holds my knife tight in
place. This could be less work than a full fledged pocket while still
improving drastically the longevity by restricting motion.</description>

        <description>I feel like many people would like some way to donate back to the community
without giving money. Seeding distribution torrents is a good way to do so,
but major distributions are already covered quite nicely.

I'm thinking, what about a system that does the following:

- 1) reads the list of distribution torrents on
     `distrowatch &lt;https://distrowatch.com/news/torrents.xml&gt;`_

- 2) rates distributions by priority using a ratio
     (popularity / lack of seeders)

- 3) given a set amount of disk space determined by the user, dynamically
  downloads as many distributions as possible in that space, ordered by
  priority, and seeds them

- 4) periodically updates the priority list, cleans up from the disk
  distributions that no longer fit the bill, and downloads the new ones


That would provide people with a completely automated "community give-back"
platform that would actually help projects in need instead of adding to the
mass of Ubuntu seeders (with all respects due to ubuntu seeders, you're
needed too).

It's not an easy project, but I think it's an attainable goal.</description>

        <description>Since Boehm GC scans the stack for things that look like pointers to objects,
could we "plant" an address to a dead struct then remove it to trigger a
double free just by manipulating stack data?</description>

        <description>`Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho
&lt;https://myanimelist.net/anime/35839/Sora_yori_mo_Tooi_Basho&gt;`_, “A place
further than the universe”...

There are many feel good stories following the life of a group of high school
girls, but none like SoraYori. It's a story of unlikely peple running away
to discover something more in their lives. The kind of story that would
motivate anyone to try anything. A story about learning what friendship
means, what making a choice means, what being alive means. A story about
doing the impossible no matter what.

A story about Antartica.

Each of the four unlikely friends has a strong personnal development which is
hard to do in only 13 episodes yet the producers manage it perfectly. The
show is well written to the point where even background characters feel alive
and unique. The artistic direction is also extremely good and I found myself
thinking several times that they way the image was framed or cut was very
ingenious. It served to present its subject with emotion and tact.

Definitive recommendation to anyone.</description>

        <description>You know how in fantasy stories there's always a huge prophecy that the hero
will defeat the forces of evil? It always bugs me that, when the main
character and prophesized hero comes, basically no country bothers raising an
army or trying to deal with the issue by itself. It's all „Well, we can't do
anything about it anyway, it's all in the hero's hands”. And fortunately it
turns out ok because prophecies in fantasy novels are always right.

I'd like a board game about that. Let's call it Prophecy.

Players could be "prophesized hero" but we'd have no way to know which is the
actual hero (or if one even is a hero). The goal would be to stop waves of
monsters and finally the demon Lord after a set number of rounds.

Fighting waves of demons can be done either by convincing countries to raise
an army or by becoming strong in their own right and fighting the horde
yourself. But the demon Lord would be special and require either a one-on-one
combat with the true hero of the prophecy or an army gathering all nations of
the world.

If someone fights off a wave alone its reputation grows, bards chant his name
and countries start getting lazy because they've found the hero or so they
think. This makes it harder to motivate them to raise an army. On the
contrary if people do not trust our heroes raising armies will be easier but
they are less likely to do as the hero says and in particular let them fight
one-on-one or set aside diplomatic issues to gather all armies of the world.

Players win if the world survives the demon Lord.

Maybe there should be something if a true prophecy was made but the true hero
wasn't found or decided not to fight the demon Lord... It sounds cool but I'm
not sure how it fits the rest of the game.

The actual mechanics behind all that are...not there. But I like the ideas and
concepts and I think it could be as simple as a card game where people have a
face-down card indicating whether they are the true hero and action cards
that are spent on convincing other countries to act as we'd like them too.
Monster waves would be a deck of cards too, last of which is the demon lord,
and each turn a card is turned face up to know what horrors invaded the
country.

I'll have to think more about all this.</description>

        <description>Just had a nice thought... Is there a real x such that x^x=i ?

.. math:: Suppose x \in \mathbb{R} solution of x^x=i

.. math::

   Suppose x \in \mathbb{R} solution of x^x=i

.. math::

   Suppose x \in \mathbb{R} solution of x^x=i
   Suppose x \in \mathbb{R} solution of x^x=i

   Suppose x \in \mathbb{R} solution of x^x=i</description>

        <description>I just tried cooking Corned Beef for the first time.

With the whole Covid-19 thing I noticed that my main issue with food wasn't
longevity but diversity and while I had no issue finding really good canned
fish, beef was another matter entirely.

And now I think I know why. It's pretty strange stuff. The can I used was as
"pur" beef as you can get, 98.7% beast and a dash of salt and E250. The smell
is not nice. You can get used to it I think. It's has a vibrant red color
which, for some reason, didn't change at all when cooked in a hot pan. This
is unusual. Beef turns grey normally when cooked. This did not change color a
bit. There's no colourant indicated though. Weird.

I had some rice and pasta leftovers so I mixed them all in a hot pan with a
dash of olive oil and the meat. Really basic, just to get a feel of the food.
I ended up adding quite a lot of black pepper and garlic as well as some hot
pepper and salt. I would really have liked an onion but there was none to be
found. Generally trying to overspice food is not a good sign, and rightly so,
but now it kind of smell like american hamburgers, where there is more spice
and herbs than actual meat.

Weird. Not bad though. Bit too much to pepper.

Will I start pilling beef cans in my stock? Probably not. The taste isn't
worth it and these cans are too big for a single meal so I'm stuck with it
for the next day at least. I would much rather have more kind of fish cans
and complete dishes such as canned raviolis in case I really start craving
meat. Still, this was a nice experience overall.</description>
