(Questions That Should Be More Frequently Asked)

Who am I?
=========

My name is CÃ©dric Picard, I am a security consultant currently working in
Luxembourg.

I spend most of my free time auditing free software, reversing malwares,
developping new GNU/Linux tools and watching animes or My Little Pony.

Why does this website look odd?
===============================

Well, I'm no web developper and I like the feeling of raw HTML/CSS. And
orange. I like orange a lot.

I'd like to talk, can I contact you?
====================================

Sure, you can mail me at the following address:
Y3BpY2FyZEBvcGVubWFpbGJveC5vcmcK

If mails aren't for you I usually hang out on irc.freenode.net under the
nickname "piou". ##security and ##programming are great places to start.
