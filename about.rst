(Questions That Should Be Asked More Frequently)

Who am I?
=========

My name is Cédric Picard, I am a security consultant currently working in
Luxembourg.

I spend most of my free time auditing free software, reversing malwares,
developping new GNU/Linux tools and watching animes or My Little Pony.

Do you have a resume?
=====================

For you, always ;) `Here it is! <file/CV_Cédric_Picard.pdf>`_

Where's the girl at the top coming from?
========================================

That's Tomoko_ from Watamote_.

Why is it on github.io? Isn't centralization bad?
=================================================

Github provides a very good service without taking control over my code. If
they decide to shut my blog down I can just repost it somewhere else. While I
like self-hosting I know that I don't want to take the time to manage a full
web server from scratch.

I like what you do, can I take it, change it, repost it?
========================================================

Sure, just indicate where you took that from and what you changed. Any
original content on this blog is under the `creative common 3.0 unported

Where does that RSS icon come from?
===================================

It is derived from `this icon
<https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/rss-feed-symbol_110>`_ which is an open
design by `freepik <https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik>`_. Thank you
for providing quality, open work.

I'd like to talk, can I contact you?
====================================

Sure, you can mail me at the following address:

If mails aren't for you I usually hang out on irc.freenode.net under the
nickname "piou". ##security and ##programming are great places to start.
