Public CVE I've been involved with
==================================

The `Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures>`_ system
is the most common way to list known vulnerabilities in largely used
products. The goal is to make it easy for security and developpers to track
specific vulnerabilities and associated vulnerable software versions. Not all
vulnerabilities get assigned CVEs, but most should have one.

Everything presented here is public, but some are prone to be forgotten
so I thought I'd provide them with a new home.
