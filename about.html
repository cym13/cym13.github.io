    <p>(Questions That Should Be More Frequently Asked)</p>
    <section id="who-am-i">
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is CÃ©dric Picard, I am a security consultant currently working in Luxembourg.</p>
        <p>I spend most of my free time auditing free software, reversing malwares, developping new GNU/Linux tools and watching animes or My Little Pony.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="why-does-this-website-look-odd">
        <h2>Why does this website look odd?</h2>
        <p>Well, I'm no web developper and I like the feeling of raw HTML/CSS. And orange. I like orange a lot.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="why-is-it-on-github-io-isn-t-centralization-bad">
        <h2>Why is it on github.io? Isn't centralization bad?</h2>
        <p>Github provides a very good service without taking control over my code. If they decide to shut my blog down I can just repost it somewhere else. While I like self-hosting I know that I don't want to take the time to manage a full web server from scratch.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="i-like-what-you-do-can-i-take-it-change-it-repost-it">
        <h2>I like what you do, can I take it, change it, repost it?</h2>
        <p>Sure, just indicate where you took that from and what you changed. Any original content on this blog is under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">creative common 3.0 unported</a> license.</p>

    <section id="i-d-like-to-talk-can-i-contact-you">
        <h2>I'd like to talk, can I contact you?</h2>
        <p>Sure, you can mail me at the following address: Y3BpY2FyZEBvcGVubWFpbGJveC5vcmcK</p>
        <p>If mails aren't for you I usually hang out on irc.freenode.net under the nickname "piou". ##security and ##programming are great places to start.</p>
